# Estimates & Budget Approval

Any work beyond routine maintenance requires a detailed written estimate before work begins. This is required for budget approval.

---

## What Requires an Estimate

- New feature development
- Third-party API integrations
- Dashboard builds
- Significant refactoring or architectural changes
- Any work that is not a straightforward bug fix or routine maintenance task

## What Does NOT Require an Estimate

- Routine maintenance (uptime response, minor config changes)
- Bug fixes for existing functionality
- Daily operational tasks (backups, syncs, monitoring)

## Estimate Format

Use [templates/estimate-request.md](templates/estimate-request.md). Each estimate must include:

- Summary of the work
- Task-by-task breakdown
- Hours estimated per task
- Total hours
- Assumptions made
- Risks that could affect the estimate

## Approval Flow

1. Developer prepares written estimate
2. Submit to **Director of AI Strategy Alignment**
3. **Wait for explicit approval before starting work**
4. Begin work only after approval received
5. Log time against the approved estimate in Clockify (see [time-tracking.md](time-tracking.md))

## Scope Changes

If actual work will exceed the approved estimate:

1. Stop and reassess before exceeding approved hours
2. Prepare a revised estimate with explanation
3. Submit to Director for re-approval
4. Do not continue beyond approved scope without approval

- [ ] Non-routine work has an approved estimate before starting
- [ ] Estimate includes task breakdown with hours
- [ ] Director approval received and documented
- [ ] Actual hours tracked against estimate in Clockify
