# Privacy & Compliance

The CAIO Hub stores project data and meeting information across multiple client organizations. Some clients may have connections to the European Union, and California privacy laws may apply. This document outlines practical privacy measures required.

---

## GDPR Awareness (EU)

Applicable when client organizations have EU connections.

- [ ] Understand lawful basis for data processing (consent, legitimate interest, contract)
- [ ] Data subject rights are supported (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
- [ ] Data processing records maintained
- [ ] Data minimization: only collect what is needed
- [ ] Flag to Director if GDPR-specific questions arise that require legal review

## California Privacy Law (CCPA/CPRA)

Applicable for California-based users.

- [ ] Users can request disclosure of collected personal information
- [ ] Users can request deletion of personal information
- [ ] "Do Not Sell" requirements understood and addressed if applicable
- [ ] Flag to Director if CCPA-specific questions arise

## Terms of Service

- [ ] TOS acceptance logged per user (timestamp, version, user ID)
- [ ] TOS version tracked — users re-accept on updates
- [ ] Acceptance records stored and queryable

## Cookie Consent

Where required:

- [ ] Cookie consent banner displayed to applicable users
- [ ] User preferences stored (accept/reject by category)
- [ ] Consent logging (timestamp, choices, user/session identifier)
- [ ] Non-essential cookies blocked until consent given

## PII Handling

- [ ] Personally identifiable information encrypted at rest
- [ ] PII access limited to authorized roles only
- [ ] PII not logged in application logs or error messages
- [ ] PII not exposed in URLs or query parameters
- [ ] Data retention policy defined: `[PLACEHOLDER — define retention periods]`

## Compliance Escalation

You are not expected to be a legal expert. When compliance questions arise:

1. Document the question and context
2. Escalate to Director of AI Strategy Alignment
3. Do not make legal determinations independently
4. Err on the side of protecting user data

## Verification

- [ ] TOS acceptance is being logged with timestamps and versions
- [ ] Cookie consent mechanism is functional where required
- [ ] PII is encrypted at rest and not exposed in logs
- [ ] Compliance questions are escalated, not decided independently
