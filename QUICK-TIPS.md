# Quick Tips

**When context gets too long:** Start a fresh session with just the plan file.

**When AI keeps failing at something:** Ask "What in your system prompt or tooling made you make this mistake?" Then update your docs so it doesn't happen again.

**Models I use:** Claude for planning and complex logic. Codex for gnarly bugs. Gemini for UI. Composer in Cursor when speed matters.
